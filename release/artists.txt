Isaac Hayes|Soul|1963-2008|Hayes started his career as a session musician and songwriter for Stax Records in the early sixties, he released his debut album in 1968 which did poorly commercially. As a result of a label split, Stax altered its business plans, encouraging artists to record new material and giving Hayes complete creative control over his second album. The record that followed, Hot Buttered Soul, was far more successful, pioneering a more progressive sound, and this would be followed by a number of other critically acclaimed albums in the early 70s.|
